# DDK_automatic_finger
It is a machine to imitate finger in touch validation of screen.
This is an idea.
<br><br/>

## Background
* When developing products of touch screens, we should imitate users' finger to validate the behavior of touch screens before selling. 
* Howerver, it is really silly to use real fingers to do this routine for several times. 
<br><br/>

## Features
* low-cost, fast to develop, easy to use 

## Platforms
* 8051 ,Arm , MCU, Arduino 
<br><br/>

## Languages
* C, C++
<br><br/>

## All the thinking is following bellow
1. We need to prepare at least two motors
2. Also a Frame which could be made by different matrials. 
3. Start to make it and ... it looks like CNC but a little differnet.
4. Beacause one of the features is low-cost and touch activity also need less energy, this make it different with CNC. 
5. The problem we should resolve is relocation and initialization.
7. ....
